SolarQuant Documentation
======================================

The SolarQuant environment tooling allows the user to easily source training data to be used for training machine
learning predictors. SolarQuant works by consuming SolarNetwork [#]_ and OrangeButton [#]_ data, both of which are free and
open source.

.. note::

   SolarQuant is under active development, and the technologies involved are too.
